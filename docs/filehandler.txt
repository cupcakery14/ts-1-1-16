documentation for handling direct access to files.


The file handler should get the files in the data folder for the command line to access and list the files.
they can be stored in a list and a method should return the list.
There should be error handling so the code doesnt crash if a file is not found/empty or a path is wrong.
use try-catch blocks to catch any errors that might come from getting the files.

Another method should read each line from a file and add it to a string.
use try-catch blocks to catch any errors while accessing the file.
use a loop to loop through each line and add it to a string.

if the file is encrypted, decrypt it before returning the file.


Testing documentation :
test that the program to see if it returns files correctly.
    - check to see if the files list is empty or not after calling getfiles.
test that program throws an error if the program tries to call the wrong file
    -check to see if readfile runs with no error after reading a fake file.
    -if .readfile returns an error, the test passes.
    -if readfile compiles without error, fail the test.
test that the program reads the files correctly.
    -if the file is null, the test fails.
    -if .readFile gets the right file, the test passes.

test that the program decrypts the files if they are encrypted.
    -test passes if the plain file and decryped file are the same after readfile is called.
